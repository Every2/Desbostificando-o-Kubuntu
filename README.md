Purges snaps, installs flatpaks, and restores vanilla GNOME
Tested on Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.04

Clone and run the script in the repo or use this oneliner: 

`bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkaulfield/ubuntu-debullshit/main/ubuntu-debullshit.sh)"`

After the install, reboot and you should have vanilla GNOME after logging in :)
