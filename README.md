Purges snaps, installs flatpaks, and restores vanilla GNOME

Use it only on Ubuntu 23.04

Clone and run the script in the repo or use this oneliner: 

`bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polkaulfield/ubuntu-debullshit/main/ubuntu-debullshit.sh)"`

After the install, reboot and choose the gnome session at login.

WARNING! This removes the snap store and firefox, and installs flathub. You can install a browser from there or as a Debian package.
